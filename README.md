Objective: The project aims to analyze the interplay between key economic indicators and fluctuations in the U.S. Dollar (USD) Index, providing insights into how various economic factors influence the strength of the USD.

Methodology:

Data Collection: Gathered historical data on economic indicators such as GDP growth rates, inflation rates, unemployment figures, and trade balances, alongside corresponding USD Index values.
Data Visualization: Utilized interactive plots to depict trends and correlations between the economic indicators and USD Index movements over time.
Statistical Analysis: Employed regression models and correlation analyses to quantify the relationships and assess the impact of each indicator on the USD Index.
Key Findings:

GDP and USD Strength: A positive correlation was observed between U.S. GDP growth and the USD Index, suggesting that robust economic performance bolsters the currency's value.
Inflation's Impact: Higher inflation rates tended to weaken the USD, indicating that purchasing power erosion affects currency strength.
Trade Balance Effects: Trade surpluses were associated with a stronger USD, while deficits corresponded with depreciation, highlighting the role of international trade in currency valuation.
Technologies Used:

Programming Languages: R for data analysis and statistical modeling.
Visualization Tools: Shiny for creating interactive web applications, ggplot2 for plotting.
Data Sources: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), and other reputable financial databases.
